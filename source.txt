ImageNet
 - million of labeled pictures
- used to train image

ILSVRC

- yearly image recognition
dataset of 1000 types of common object
-------------------------------------------------
 Included image Recognition models
- VGG (university of Oxford): 16 or 19 layers, take a lot of memory to run)
- Resnet50 (microsoft research): 50 layer, use less memory than VGG
- Inception-v3 (Google): performs very well
- Xception (Francois Chollet, author of Keras): more accurate than Inception-v3, use same amounr of memory
